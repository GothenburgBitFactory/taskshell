.SH NAME
tasksh \- Interactive taskwarrior shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tasksh
.br
.B tasksh --version

.SH DESCRIPTION
The tasksh program can be used to create a more immersive taskwarrior
environment.  Any task command you run outside the shell can also be run inside
the shell, without the need to prefix every command with "task".

When built with libreadline, tasksh provides command editing and history.

Tasksh supports all recent versions of Taskwarrior.

.SH COMMANDS
Tasksh supports the following commands.  All other commands are passed intact to
Taskwarrior.

.TP
.B diagnostics
Displays settings pertinent to tasksh, for diagnosing problems.

.TP
.B exit/quit
These commands cause tasksh to terminate, returning you to your system shell.

.TP
.B help
Shows how to obtain help.

.TP
.B review [N]
Begins an interactive review session, where you can mark tasks as reviewed,
modify them using your text editor, or skip them. You can terminate a review
session at any time.
Finds your pending and waiting tasks that need to be reviewed. By default this
means any task with a missing 'reviewed' date, or with a 'reviewed' date that
is older than a week. This means if you run the 'review' command to completion,
a subsequent 'review' command will find no tasks to review, until a week has
elapsed.
If 'N' is provided, the session is limited to reviewing only N tasks.

Note: requires Taskwarrior 2.5.0 or later.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Tasksh piggybacks on Taskwarrior's .taskrc configuration file, and stores
several settings there. If you use a non-standard location for your .task
database, and .taskrc file, Tasksh will not find them unless you set the
TASKDATA and TASKRC environment variables. See 'man taskrc' for more
details.
